# HF-055: TRAINING SIGNAL PERSISTENCE — SCOPE DECISION

Prompt committed for traceability. Full specification in conversation context.

## Scope: 6 Missions, 22 Proof Gates

- Phase 0: Diagnostic — AI signal system audit
- Mission 1: Ensure classification_signals table exists
- Mission 2: Create signal persistence service
- Mission 3: Wire sheet classification → persistence
- Mission 4: Wire field mapping → persistence + closed loop
- Mission 5: Wire remaining AI call sites
- Mission 6: Signal observability + build + CLT
- Phase Final: Completion report + PR

## Key Constraint
Wire what exists. Persist what's captured. Close the loop where possible.
Do NOT build new AI call sites or assessment panels.
