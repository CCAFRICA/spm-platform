# VP SESSION HANDOFF — 2026-06-16

**Session window:** 2026-06-16, approximately 8+ hours of continuous work.
**Primary outcome:** The MIR proof tenant's 15-file data import (75,227 rows) and 5-plan PDF import were unblocked after a five-directive forensic arc; the root cause was a server-side post-commit blocking the HTTP response (fixed by PR #530, `6e49db8a`). A second, now-confirmed regression (DIAG-071) leaves the Calculate page showing 1 of 5 plans with 0 entities — the fix directive (HF-300) is drafted and ready, NOT yet run.
**Reader orientation:** read Sections -1, 0, 19, and 20 first. This handoff is dense by design — paste it directly into the opening directive of the next conversation. HF-300 will be running in the next session.
**Drafting note:** drafted against `HANDOFF_TEMPLATE.md` v1.0 with `HANDOFF_TEMPLATE_CORRECTIONS.md` Corrections 1–19 applied. This is a VP (platform/repo) handoff, not a governance handoff — IGF-specific sections (6 Meta candidates, 8 TMR, 16 governance engine) are marked N/A with reasoning per template §5 latitude.

## SECTION -1 — CRITICAL PATH TO OBJECTIVE
*(Correction 19 — required, read first)*

1. **What we are building.** Vialuce (vialuce.ai) is a B2B Incentive Compensation Management / Sales Performance Management platform. Its distinguishing architecture is a domain-agnostic prime-DAG calculation engine fed by a convergence layer that maps any tenant's spreadsheet columns to plan metrics with no per-tenant code, riding a fingerprint-based decreasing-cost recognition curve (Progressive Performance). The billable unit is the "Verified Payout" — a commission calculated, reconciled, and audit-sealed. Repo: `CCAFRICA/spm-platform` ("VP"), Next.js / Supabase / Vercel Pro.

2. **Why it matters.** LATAM enterprise sales teams (initial focus Peru/Mexico) run incentive compensation on opaque spreadsheets and legacy tools that produce disputed, unauditable payouts. Vialuce centralizes complex comp rules, automates calculation, makes every payout transparent and disputable in-platform, and natively handles clawbacks/reversals/retroactive adjustments — rebuilding seller trust in the incentive model. Pricing is population-band tiered with the Verified Payout as the billable unit.

3. **Current commercial gate / next user-facing milestone.** The **MIR demo** (Almacenes Mirasol, tenant `972c8eb0-e3ae-4e4c-ad30-8b34804c893a`, PEN/Lima/es-PE) — a Spanish-language end-to-end demonstration on a realistic 5-plan, ~75k-row LATAM tenant, calculated and reconciled against locked ground truth (`MIR_Resultados_Esperados.xlsx`). This is the first proof tenant with five concurrent plans.

4. **Binding constraint.** **The Calculate page is broken on the MIR tenant: 1 of 5 plans visible, 0 entities assigned.** DIAG-071 (PR #532, `391e96c3`) confirmed two compounding defects with DB + code evidence. **HF-300** (drafted, ready, not run) fixes both. Until HF-300 lands and the MIR tenant shows 5 plans with assigned entities, the demo cannot proceed to calculation and reconciliation.

5. **Frame of reference for next session.** Every action filters through: *"does this make the MIR tenant calculate all 5 plans correctly and reconcile against ground truth, or is it local optimization?"* If local optimization, defer. Named non-critical-path residuals (execute-phase polling noise, per-file post-commit redundancy, numbering-ledger reconciliation) are explicitly deferred until the Calculate path is restored and a first reconciliation is achieved.

---

## SECTION 0 — CRITICAL ORIENTATION FACTS

1. **State change:** MIR 15-file import (75,227 rows, ~2m18s) and 5-plan import both completed on production. Real fix = PR #530 / `6e49db8a` (post-commit deferred to `waitUntil` background so the response returns immediately after the commit loop). Main HEAD = `897009b2`.
2. **Open incident:** Calculate page is broken — 1 of 5 plans, 0 entities. Root cause CONFIRMED by DIAG-071 (PR #532). Two defects: C1 tenant-scoped supersession (latent), C3 assignments failing in the new `waitUntil` background (recent regression from PR #530).
3. **Forward instrument:** HF-300 fix directive is drafted and downloadable (`HF-300_SUPERSESSION_ASSIGNMENT_FIX_20260616.md`). It fixes C1 + C3 in one branch with a mandatory committed completion report. HF-300 was confirmed free in the repo (no committed artifact bears that number).
4. **Numbering integrity (PERMANENT DAMAGE):** This session repeatedly fabricated sequence numbers in chat ("HF-290," "HF-297" as a label for PR #530); the architect corrected each. **A permanent, unrecoverable gap now exists in the HF sequence:** the import fix shipped inside CC's committed work (PR #530, `6e49db8a`) WITHOUT a completion report, because the drafter did not enforce completion-report-before-PR on that fix and did not control its numbering. That number is held only internally in CC's commit history with no external viewable completion-report artifact — it cannot be reconstructed. The fix directive is renumbered to **HF-300** to move past the corrupted range. DIAG-071's verdict text also mislabeled PR #530 as "HF-297" — a chat label, not a repo fact.
5. **Recommended next action:** Run HF-300 (read ledger to confirm 297, fix C1+C3, committed completion report, PR). Then regenerate stale `SCHEMA_REFERENCE_LIVE.md`, calculate MIR January 2025, reconcile against ground truth.

## SECTION 1 — SESSION GOALS AND OUTCOMES

**Set out to do:** Get the MIR proof-tenant data package imported and the tenant ready for calculation and Spanish-language demo rehearsal. The data package (15 Excel files ~75k rows, 5 Spanish plan PDFs, ground truth) was already built and locked entering the session.

**Actually did:** The multi-file import was catastrophically broken — files committed one at a time with ~5-minute stalls ending in Vercel 300s timeouts and auth session-expiry. Five successive directives (HF-295, HF-295 Part 2, HF-296, then DIAG-069/DIAG-070 forensics) chased the wrong layer — the client-side settle mechanism — because the per-file work was assumed to be ~2 seconds when it was never measured. DIAG-070's trace instrumentation finally proved the real cause: the server held the HTTP response through `executePostCommitConstruction` (whole-tenant entity resolution) until Vercel killed the function at 300s. PR #530 moved that post-commit work to a `waitUntil` background; the response now returns immediately after the commit loop. Import works: 15/15 files, 75,227 rows, ~2m18s, zero LLM calls (Progressive Performance: 144 atoms recalled). The 5 plans then imported. But the Calculate page surfaced a second regression — 1 of 5 plans, 0 entities — which DIAG-071 root-caused to (C1) tenant-scoped rule_set supersession and (C3) assignment creation failing inside the new `waitUntil` background. HF-300 is drafted to fix both.

**One sentence:** Import unblocked after a long mis-aimed arc finally corrected by trace evidence; a second confirmed Calculate regression remains, with its fix (HF-300) drafted and queued to run next session.

---

## SECTION 2 — REPO STATE AT SESSION CLOSE

- **Repo:** `CCAFRICA/spm-platform` (VP). Git operations from repo root, not `web/`.
- **Main HEAD:** `897009b2` (contains PR #530 fix `6e49db8a` on top of DIAG-070 instrumentation `d5f48d19`).
- **Key commits this session:** HF-295 (`0567eef0` and predecessors), HF-296 (`04cf7ac1`), DIAG-070 (`8336abef` / `d5f48d19`), PR #530 background fix (`6e49db8a`), DIAG-071 (`391e96c3`).
- **External state — Vercel:** production deploys from `main` separately after merge; production deployment confirmed `dpl_BeJJ9yRF2FdVsRKGSd8FsEQ57v5A` = main HEAD during the successful import run. **Lesson burned in: a green PR check is the preview build, not production. Always confirm the production deployment SHA before judging a fix.**
- **External state — Supabase:** project `bayqxeiltnpjrvflksfa` (VP production). MIR tenant `972c8eb0-e3ae-4e4c-ad30-8b34804c893a`: 75,227 rows in `committed_data`, 553 entities, **1 active rule_set / 11 archived** (the defect), 553 assignments stranded on archived plan `c3574b89`.
- **DIAG-070 trace instrumentation (`[TRACE-SERVER]`/`[TRACE-CLIENT]`/`[TRACE-POLL]`) is still in the code on main.** It is behavior-neutral but should be removed or gated in a later cleanup once the Calculate regression is closed.

---

## SECTION 3 — PR TIMELINE (SESSION-SCOPED)

| PR | Title (short) | Base | Merge SHA | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| #527 | HF-295 file-scoped settle | main | (in arc) | File-scoped settle + per-file failure isolation (wrong layer, merged) |
| #528 | HF-296 settle replacement | main | `04cf7ac1` | Settle trusts 200, recovery-only; poller terminal stops (wrong layer, merged) |
| #529 | DIAG-070 trace instrumentation | main | `d5f48d19` | `[TRACE-*]` per-phase logs across import write path (read-only instrumentation) |
| #530 | Post-commit deferred to background | main | `6e49db8a` | **THE FIX** — response returns after commit loop; post-commit in `waitUntil` |
| #532 | DIAG-071 Calculate audit | main | `391e96c3` | Read-only root-cause of multi-plan/zero-assignment regression |

(HF-295 Part 1/Part 2 and the predecessors of #527 are part of the same arc; SHAs in the transcript.)

## SECTION 4 — IMPORT REGRESSION EXECUTION CYCLE (MAIN WORK SURFACE)

The arc, gate by gate, including the wrong turns (recorded so they are not repeated):

1. **Stale model string** (early): `claude-sonnet-4-20250514` 404'd; corrected to `claude-sonnet-4-6`. Fingerprint Tier-1 matches bypassed it, so this was not the import blocker.
2. **HF-295 (PR #527, from DIAG-069):** diagnosed settle-scope mismatch (`settleFromSurface` gated import-wide not per-file). Fixed file-scoped settle + per-file failure isolation. **Did not fix production** — wrong layer.
3. **HF-296 (PR #528):** replaced settle mechanism — trust HTTP 200, poll recovery-only. **Did not fix production** — wrong layer. CC surfaced the correct insight that there is no separate import-list poller; the noise is the execute-phase `/session-state` polls.
4. **DIAG-070 (PR #529):** full git forensics + `[TRACE-SERVER]`/`[TRACE-CLIENT]`/`[TRACE-POLL]` instrumentation. **This is what cracked it.** Trace proved: `[TRACE-CLIENT] DISPATCH-START` then zero further client lines (the `await fetch()` never returned); `[TRACE-SERVER] post-commit-construction-start` with no `-end` (server held the response through whole-tenant entity resolution until the 300s kill). The per-file work was ~25s server-side for a 521-row file — never the assumed ~2s. The client settle was never the bottleneck.
5. **PR #530 (`6e49db8a`):** execute-bulk returns the response immediately after the per-unit commit loop; the post-commit tail (`executePostCommitConstruction`, `createMissingAssignments`, `emitFlywheelSignals`, `populateStoreMetadata`) runs in a `waitUntil()` background via `@vercel/functions` (Next 14.2 has no `after`; bare fire-and-forget freezes on lambda return). **Import works:** 15/15 files, 75,227 rows, ~2m18s, per-file server times 0.9s–16.8s (scale-proportional), no timeout, no auth starvation.
6. **5-plan import:** completed; 5 plans interpreted.
7. **Calculate regression surfaced** → DIAG-071 (Section 5).

---

## SECTION 5 — CALCULATE REGRESSION (SECONDARY WORK SURFACE — DIAG-071)

DIAG-071 (PR #532, `391e96c3`) root-caused with DB + code:

- **C1 CONFIRMED (latent, pre-OB-203):** `plan-interpretation.ts:363-368` archives ALL prior rule_sets for the tenant with no plan-identity filter. DB: 1 active, 11 archived → only last-imported plan survives → "1 of 5 plans." Tenant-scoped since HF-239 (2026-05-19) — a single-plan-per-tenant assumption surfacing on the first 5-plan tenant.
- **C2 DISPROVEN:** `createMissingAssignments` has no LIMIT-1; it loops all active rule_sets. The single-plan effect is entirely C1.
- **C3 CONFIRMED (recent regression, from PR #530):** `createMissingAssignments` moved into the `waitUntil` post-commit background, which fetch-fails on Vercel (`TypeError: fetch failed`, logged 22:38:14). DB: 553 assignments all on archived plan `c3574b89`; active plan has 0. `assignment-creation.ts:45` only assigns to `status='active'` → "0 entities."
- **Calc "Failed to fetch"** = separate downstream client TypeError at `calculate/page.tsx:252`; would be empty regardless with 0 assigned entities.

**Fix = HF-300 (drafted, not run):** C1 → supersede by plan identity (content_hash or name), not tenant-wide, idempotent (reimport 5 → 5 active). C3 → post-commit assignment work cannot ride a detached background that dies on Vercel; CC selects the runtime-supported approach (fresh client in background / deferred single post-import step / calc-time self-heal) + reconcile the 553 stranded assignments. Preserves PR #530's import-speed win. Mandatory committed completion report.

---

## SECTION 6 — META CANDIDATES
N/A — VP session, not governance. IGF Meta-candidate capture is a governance-channel mechanism. The defect patterns from this session are captured in Section 12.

---

## SECTION 7 — DECISIONS LOCKED AND UNLOCKED THIS SESSION

No new numbered Decisions locked. No Decisions unlocked.

**Operational/path decisions made this session (bind future work):**
- PR #530's `waitUntil` background approach is the accepted shape for deferring post-commit work off the import response — but C3 proves the background must use a fetch context that survives response flush. HF-300 must not undo #530.
- Plan supersession is plan-scoped, not tenant-scoped (HF-300 C1). The intended reimport model: each plan is its own PDF/identity; reimporting one plan supersedes only that plan.
- Deployment-SHA-verify-before-judging is now permanent operational discipline.

---

## SECTION 8 — TMR CANDIDATES
Zero direct TMR candidates this session. Indirect: the "deployment SHA ≠ green PR check" lesson and the "measure per-file cost before fixing a perceived stall" lesson may eventually migrate to a build-operations reference; defer disposition.

---

## SECTION 9 — CLT ENTRIES

Zero formal CLT entries created this session.

**Informal browser/runtime verification artifacts produced:** the CLT-213 series of import/Calculate screenshots and production-log captures (referenced as `CLT213_*` PDFs in session), the successful 15-file import trace run, the 5-plan import completion screen, and the Calculate-error screen. These are evidence, not committed CLT findings.

---

## SECTION 10 — SR-39 COMPLIANCE GATE STATE

N/A for the import fix itself (no auth/access-control/encryption change — PR #530 is response-ordering and background-task scheduling). **Flag for HF-300:** the C3 fix touches how a service-role Supabase client is constructed in a background task; HF-300's completion report should confirm no RLS/service-role exposure change and that the background client uses service-role appropriately (the `processing_jobs` 403 RLS note in logs is a separate OB-174 async-path fallback, already handled).

---

## SECTION 11 — STANDING RULES STATE

`CC_STANDING_ARCHITECTURE_RULES.md` — no amendments this session. In force and exercised: SR-34 (diagnose/fix structurally, no workarounds — honored by refusing to ship single-file-import as a "solution"), SR-43 (ship completes the work item — completion report + production verification), SR-44 (browser verification, SQL Editor migrations, PR merges are architect-only). **Promotion candidate queued:** "verify production deployment SHA before interpreting any fix's runtime behavior" — recurring enough this session to warrant a standing rule.

---

## SECTION 12 — DEFECT CLASS ANALYSIS *(required)*

**Root failure pattern this session: acting on an unverified assumption about where cost/time was spent, and fixing the assumed layer repeatedly without instrumenting the actual execution.**

Surfaces where it manifested:
- **Assumed per-file work was ~2s** (never measured) → three client-side settle fixes (HF-295, HF-295 P2, HF-296) at the wrong layer. The real cost was ~25s server-side, provable only by the `[SCI Bulk] Complete: <rows> in <ms>` line and the DIAG-070 trace.
- **Assumed the fixes were running in production** when behavior didn't change → nearly chased a "stale build" theory before confirming the deployment SHA. The actual issue was the wrong layer, not a stale deploy.
- **Sequence-number fabrication in chat** (HF-290, "HF-297" as a label for PR #530, premature DIAG numbers) — corrected by the architect each time. **One consequence is permanent:** PR #530's import fix was committed without a completion report and without architect-controlled numbering, leaving an unrecoverable gap in the HF sequence (the fix is renumbered forward to HF-300 to move past the corrupted range). The pattern is the documented "sequence number fabrication = SOP violation; read the live repo before assigning; completion report before PR."
- **Framing broken-stable-code as missing-functionality** — initially mis-cast the Calculate multi-plan failure as "build multi-plan support" when it is broken supersession + a fresh `waitUntil` regression on a path that worked for weeks.

Why the catch eventually worked: DIAG-070's trace instrumentation replaced theory with per-phase timestamps; DIAG-071's DB queries replaced theory with row counts. **The lesson, stated for the next session: instrument and query before prescribing. The architect repeatedly and correctly forced this; the drafter repeatedly defaulted to theorizing from logs. Carry the instrument-first discipline forward.**

---

## SECTION 13 — FILES CREATED OR MODIFIED THIS SESSION

- **Modified (code, committed):** `SCIExecution.tsx` (settle rework HF-295/296 — superseded in effect by #530), `execute-bulk/route.ts` (PR #530 response-before-post-commit + `@vercel/functions` `waitUntil`; DIAG-070 `[TRACE-SERVER]`), `ImportTelemetryPanel.tsx` (`[TRACE-POLL]`), `plan-interpretation.ts` / `assignment-creation.ts` (read in DIAG-071, not yet modified — HF-300 will).
- **Created (documentation, committed):** DIAG-069, DIAG-070, DIAG-071 reports under `docs/diagnostics/`; HF-295/296 completion reports under `docs/completion-reports/`.
- **Created (artifacts, NOT in repo — architect-channel, downloadable):** `HF-300_SUPERSESSION_ASSIGNMENT_FIX_20260616.md` (the fix directive, ready to paste to CC), this handoff.
- **To be created next session:** HF-300 branch + completion report; regenerated `SCHEMA_REFERENCE_LIVE.md` (stale since 2026-03-18).

---

## SECTION 14 — CONVERSATION PATTERN OBSERVATIONS

**Productive patterns that held:** trace instrumentation as the circuit-breaker out of a theorizing loop; DB queries to adjudicate competing hypotheses (DIAG-071's three-candidate table); the architect's insistence on CRF+PCD gates with evidence before drafting.

**Unproductive patterns caught and corrected mid-session:** (a) deferring the drafter's own deep analysis to CC instead of prescribing the precise fix — the drafter has whole-arc context CC lacks; (b) suggesting starting a new conversation without critical evidence (explicitly forbidden by the architect); (c) placating restatement of mistakes instead of action; (d) sequence-number fabrication. All four were corrected by the architect and are recorded here so the next session does not repeat them.

**Drift risk not closed:** the drafter's tendency to hand CC open investigations rather than precise, code-justified directives. The next session must keep the drafter doing the synthesis and CC doing the code reads/edits — not invert it.

---

## SECTION 15 — CC EXECUTION OBSERVATIONS

CC was central. **Above baseline:** CC's correction that there is no separate import-list poller (the noise is the execute-phase `/session-state` polls); CC's refusal to fabricate a per-file timing table it could not see, while building the correct framework to interpret it; DIAG-070 forensics correctly isolating the regression commit; DIAG-071's clean three-candidate adjudication with DB evidence. **At baseline:** CC executed each (mis-aimed) directive faithfully — the mis-aim was the drafter's, not CC's. **Note:** CC inherited the chat-level "HF-297" mislabel from the drafter in its DIAG-071 verdict text; the fix directive is renumbered to **HF-300** and instructs CC to verify that number is free in the repo before committing.

---

## SECTION 16 — GOVERNANCE ENGINE POSITION
N/A — VP session. No IGF substrate work this session. (Governance substrate stands where the last governance handoff left it; this session did not touch `vialuce-governance`.)

---

## SECTION 17 — HANDOFF BEST-PRACTICE OBSERVATIONS

Corrections applied during drafting: **Correction 19** (Section -1 Critical Path to Objective, populated and placed first); **Corrections 2 & 5** (Section 19 Turn 2 is minimum-viable — one git command + one verbal confirmation, zero ceremonial commands); **Correction 1** (explicit execution locus on every Section 19/20 action); **Correction 18 supplemental** (prior-art search before "new mechanism" claims — applied when reframing the Calculate failure from "new functionality" to "broken supersession + regression"). VP-specific latitude taken on governance-only sections (6, 8, 16) per template §5, with N/A reasoning rather than omission. Length is justified by the five-directive arc and the open regression.

---

## SECTION 18 — RISKS AND OPEN QUESTIONS FOR NEXT SESSION

**Risks:**
1. **HF-300 C3 fix could reintroduce the 300s timeout** if assignment work is moved back in front of the response per-file. Mitigation: HF-300 §1.2 forbids this; CC must choose a background/deferred approach that preserves #530's speed.
2. **The `waitUntil` background may be silently failing for more than just assignments** (the 22:38:14 log also shows signal-write `fetch failed`). Mitigation: HF-300 §3.1 requires verifying whether `waitUntil` even runs in this runtime before designing; if it doesn't, signals AND assignments both need the deferred-step approach.
3. **The 553 stranded assignments** on the archived plan need explicit reconciliation, not just forward-correctness. Mitigation: HF-300 §3.3.
4. **DIAG-070 `[TRACE-*]` logging remains on main** — verbose; should be removed/gated post-fix.

**Open questions:**
1. **Plan identity key for supersession** — content_hash vs name. CC reads `rule_sets` schema in HF-300 §2.2 to choose the most stable available field. (Not an architect HALT — delegated as a schema read.)
2. **Multi-plan materialization in results** — once 5 plans are active and assigned, does `entity_period_outcomes` correctly hold all 5 plans' results, or does a delete-then-insert wipe prior plans? This is the NEXT blocker after HF-300, flagged in the memory profile. Verify during the first MIR calculation.

---

## SECTION 19 — IMMEDIATE NEXT SESSION START SCRIPT
*(Corrections 1, 2, 5 applied — minimum-viable, explicit locus)*

**Turn 1 — Claude reads.** New-Conversation Claude reads this handoff (Sections -1, 0, 19, 20 first). Claude states orientation grounded in Section -1 sub-sections 3 and 4: *"Milestone = MIR demo end-to-end calculate+reconcile; binding constraint = Calculate page broken (1 of 5 plans, 0 entities), fix = HF-300 ready to run."* Architect confirms or corrects.

**Turn 2 — verification (minimum-viable).**
- **Andrew runs locally:** `git log origin/main --oneline -3` — confirms `897009b2` (the PR #530 fix) is the head as this handoff describes. Pastes output.
- **Verbal confirmation:** "Any manual state changes to git, Supabase, Vercel, or credentials since session close? If none, proceed."
- That is the entire Turn 2. (Risk 1–4 in Section 18 do not require a fresh pre-check; they are handled inside HF-300 execution.)

**Turn 3 — execute HF-300.** Architect pastes `HF-300_SUPERSESSION_ASSIGNMENT_FIX_20260616.md` to CC. CC verifies HF-300 is unused in `docs/vp-prompts/` and `docs/completion-reports/`, fixes C1 (plan-identity supersession) + C3 (assignment reliability without reintroducing the timeout), reconciles the 553 stranded assignments, commits the completion report, opens the PR. **Architect (SR-44):** verifies the production deployment SHA contains the HF-300 commit, then runs the proof gate (reimport 5 plans → 5 active rule_sets; assignments non-zero on active plans; Calculate shows 5 plans with entity counts; import speed preserved; single-plan-tenant regression check).

---

## SECTION 20 — PATH DETAIL

**Path A — HF-300 (the binding constraint).** Identifier: HF-300. Scope: plan-identity supersession (C1) + post-commit assignment reliability (C3) + stranded-assignment reconciliation. Dependencies: none — ready to run. Gates: the §4 proof gate (5 active rule_sets, non-zero assignments, 5 plans on Calculate, preserved import speed, single-plan regression). Meta rules baked in: Korean Test (structural identity, no plan-name strings), Scale-by-Design (N plans not 5), do-not-undo-#530, mandatory committed completion report. Estimated: 1 focused session. **Sequence: first. Everything else waits on this.**

**Path B — Schema reference regeneration.** Identifier: no OB — maintenance. Scope: regenerate `SCHEMA_REFERENCE_LIVE.md` (stale since 2026-03-18) from the live DB. Dependencies: none, but best done alongside HF-300 since HF-300 reads schema. Estimated: short. Sequence: with or immediately after Path A.

**Path C — First MIR calculation + reconciliation.** Identifier: no OB — proof milestone. Scope: calculate MIR January 2025 across all 5 plans; CC reports calculated values verbatim; architect reconciles against `MIR_Resultados_Esperados.xlsx` (reconciliation stays architect-channel — CC never compares). Dependencies: Path A complete (5 plans active + assigned). Likely surfaces the multi-plan materialization question (Section 18 OQ2) and Plan 1's base+accelerator split (ground truth reconciles their SUM). Estimated: 1 session. Sequence: after A.

**Path D — Named residuals.** Execute-phase polling noise (directed killed 3×, must not START during execute — one change, two files: `SCIExecution.tsx` + `ImportTelemetryPanel.tsx`); per-file 15× whole-tenant post-commit redundancy (collapse to once-after-last-file — overlaps HF-300 §3 Option B); `[TRACE-*]` log removal; numbering-ledger reconciliation. Dependencies: none individually, but all explicitly DEFERRED until Calculate works and a first reconciliation lands. Sequence: after C.

**Recommendation across all paths:** Run **Path A (HF-300) first, immediately, in the next session.** It is the single binding constraint to the MIR demo milestone. Fold Path B in opportunistically. Then Path C to achieve the first 5-plan reconciliation — the actual demo-readiness proof. Defer Path D entirely until then. Do not let any Path D residual (especially the polling noise, which is cosmetic at MIR scale) pull focus from restoring Calculate.
