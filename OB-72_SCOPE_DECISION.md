# OB-72: FIVE LAYERS OF PROOF + FINAL GAP CLOSURE

Prompt committed for traceability. Full specification in conversation context.

## Scope: 6 Missions, 24 Proof Gates + 22-item Browser CLT

- Phase 0: Diagnostic — five layers, field mappings, audit logs, disputes, anomaly
- Architecture Decision Gate: UI pattern, field mappings replacement, audit pattern
- Mission 1: Five Layers — Layer 5 Outcome + Layer 4 Population
- Mission 2: Five Layers — Layer 3 Component + Layer 2 Metric
- Mission 3: Anomaly auto-invoke + dispute from proof view + detail fix
- Mission 4: FIELD_ID_MAPPINGS removal — Korean Test
- Mission 5: Audit logging on critical paths
- Mission 6: Browser-verified integration CLT (22 items with pasted evidence)
- Phase Final: Completion report + PR

## Key Constraint
Build Five Layers drill-down. Remove hardcoded field names. Add audit logging.
Browser-verify everything. Do NOT build Layer 1 (Interpretation), billing, or org discovery.
