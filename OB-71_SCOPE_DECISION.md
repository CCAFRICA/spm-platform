# OB-71: AI INTELLIGENCE LAYER + AUTH AUDIT + ACCUMULATED FIXES

Prompt committed for traceability. Full specification in conversation context.

## Scope: 6 Missions, 28 Proof Gates

- Phase 0: Diagnostic — auth flow, AI assessment, accumulated gaps
- Mission 1: Auth audit and fix
- Mission 2: AI Assessment Panel — admin persona
- Mission 3: Coaching Agenda — manager persona
- Mission 4: Anomaly detection + rep assessment
- Mission 5: Accumulated fixes (locale, badges, signals, labels, disputes)
- Mission 6: Integration CLT + build
- Phase Final: Completion report + PR

## Key Constraint
Fix auth definitively. Build AI intelligence layer. Clean up accumulated gaps.
Do NOT build Five Layers of Proof, full reconciliation, or billing.
