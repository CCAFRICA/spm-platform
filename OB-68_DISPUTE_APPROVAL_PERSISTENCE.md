# OB-68: DISPUTE + APPROVAL PERSISTENCE + LIFECYCLE STATE

**Autonomy Directive: NEVER ask yes/no. NEVER say "shall I". NEVER pause for confirmation. Read the full prompt, then execute every phase sequentially. Commit after each phase. Push after each commit.**

**Date:** 2026-02-20
**Scope:** Dispute persistence, approval persistence, lifecycle state immutability, audit logging
**Motivation:** OB-66 P0 findings — in-memory Maps and demo seeds masquerade as real state

*"If it doesn't survive a reload, it doesn't exist."*
