━━━ LAYER 1: DATA INGESTION INFRASTRUCTURE ━━━
Question: How did the platform resolve entities and periods?

  [..]  Entity Resolution Method [PARTIAL] KR:FAIL
     Resolved via column "unknown". Column name may be in hardcoded target list

  [..]  Entity Linkage Coverage [PARTIAL] KR:OK
     191946/238276 rows linked (80.6%)

  [OK] Period Resolution Coverage [STRUCTURAL] KR:OK
     238276/238276 rows period-linked (100.0%). 8 periods detected.

  [OK] Semantic data_type Classification [STRUCTURAL] KR:OK
     1 data_types: [Base_Clientes_Nuevos]. All semantic.


━━━ LAYER 2: PLAN INTELLIGENCE INFRASTRUCTURE ━━━
Question: Are plans interpreted as structural primitives, not domain-specific configs?

  [XX] calculationIntent Coverage [NOT_FIRING] KR:OK
     0/4 components have calculationIntent. Operations used: []. 1 legacy-only (no intent).

  [OK] Structural Primitive Vocabulary [STRUCTURAL] KR:OK
     Primitives used: []. Compound operations: NO. postProcessing present: NO.

  [..]  Compound Operation Execution [PARTIAL] KR:OK
     No compound operations detected.


━━━ LAYER 3: CONVERGENCE INFRASTRUCTURE ━━━
Question: Is convergence structurally matching semantic types, or pattern-matching on field names?

  [XX] input_bindings Coverage [NOT_FIRING] KR:OK
     0/1 plans have non-empty input_bindings. Methods: []

  [XX] Metric Derivation Rules [NOT_FIRING] KR:OK
     0 derivation rules. count+filter: 0, sum+field: 0. Rules use structural operations (count, sum) with data-driven parameters.

  [OK] Classification Signal Capture [STRUCTURAL] KR:OK
     140 signals captured. Types: [training:dashboard_assessment, training:assessment_generated, training:synaptic_density, training:plan_interpretation, training:workbook_analysis, training:field_mapping_second_pass, training:dual_path_concordance]


━━━ LAYER 4: CALCULATION ENGINE INFRASTRUCTURE ━━━
Question: Does the engine use structural primitives, or does it have domain-specific switch cases?

  [OK] Result Coverage [STRUCTURAL] KR:OK
     3607 results generated (expected max: 8000 = 1 plans x 8 periods x 1000 entities). Non-zero payouts: 2105/3607.

  [..]  Payout Distribution Health [PARTIAL] KR:FAIL
     Plan de Comisiones Optica Luminar 2026: 12/12 non-zero, total=$20662.00, range=[$349.00, $3348.00] | Imported Plan: 0/988 non-zero, total=$0.00, range=[$0.00, $0.00] SUSPICIOUS: Imported Plan: ALL ZERO


━━━ LAYER 5: CODE STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY (Korean Test) ━━━
Question: Does the foundational code contain domain-specific strings?

  [OK] Calculation Engine Domain Vocab [STRUCTURAL] KR:OK
     Zero domain vocabulary in calculation engine code (non-comment).

  [OK] Convergence Engine Domain Vocab [STRUCTURAL] KR:OK
     Zero domain vocabulary in convergence code (non-comment).

  [OK] Hardcoded Field Names in lib/ [STRUCTURAL] KR:OK
     Zero hardcoded field names in library code.

  [..]  SHEET_COMPONENT_PATTERNS Usage [PARTIAL] KR:FAIL
     15 references to SHEET_COMPONENT_PATTERNS. Still widely used — convergence should replace more.
